crisis. There were almost 53 million unit of SME in Indonesia and those units provide jobs to almost 100 million citizen of Indonesia. The economy census conducted by Central Bureau of Statistic (Badan Pusat Statistik/ BPS) in 2016 showed that out of 26.7 million businesses (apart from agriculture sector), 98.33% of them were SMEs. This provides a perception of how much small businesses can impact the society. SMEs rose in performance in the past few years which could be seen from the increased amount of development of SMEs each year. That rapid development in the SMEs sector showed that there is great potential to realise prosperous society [@Azevedo2019].

Real GDP per employee was $103,000 for small business, while productivity payroll dollar was $2.44 for small businesses, while for large businesses, it was $2.20. The analysis also revealed Small Business GSP (SGDP) increased over the 1998 to 2014 period. As small businesses grow, they may change from a small businesses to large one or are acquired by a large enterprise.
